## What You Need to Have
1. Text Editor (If you already have a preferred Text Editor, ignore the following subpoints)
    - [Atom.io] (https://atom.io/)
    - Install helpful packages: 
      - [autoclose-html] (https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html) - autocloses HTML tags
      - [javascript-snippets] (https://atom.io/packages/javascript-snippets) - shortcuts for JS functions
    - [HOW DO I INSTALL ATOM PACKAGES???] (http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/)
2. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.ca/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) (If you don't have Chrome, what are you doing with your life?  Jks, but basically any web browser with a console, so Firefox works too!)

Goals:
- Introduce JavaScript
- Basic operations (for loops, arrays, etc.)
- == vs ===
- Objects
- ES6+ functionality (spread, function =>)
- Let vs var
- Array Operations (forEach, slicing, map, reduce, filter)
- Interaction with DOM  (i.e. querySelector(All))
- Error handling with console
- * Will not go into CSS (i.e. transitions, add classes)*
